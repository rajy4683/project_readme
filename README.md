# Exciting Projects on Computer Vision, MLOPs and NLP applications

1. [Depth estimation from monocular images and simultaneous mask generation](https://github.com/rajy4683/project_readme/blob/master/Project_MonoDepth.pdf)

   The objective of this project is to handle the joint tasks of:

   - predicting the depth of the background given a single image file (i.e no LiDAR or RGB-D data) 
   - Reliable recreating image masks for the foreground objects/people.

2. [LeetBeed: An AI automation Platform](https://github.com/rajy4683/project_readme/blob/master/Project_LeetBeed.pdf)

   LeetBeed is a web platform to help faster and automated creation of Vision and Text models without any coding. The models  can be automatically deployed to AWS Lambda with a simple webservice frontend for testing and using the deployed endpoints

3. [Project NoCoder](https://github.com/rajy4683/project_readme/blob/master/Project_NoCoDeR.pdf)

   A code suggestion model based on Transformers which will provide the Python code based on user query in English.
