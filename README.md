# README for DL/ML projects

1. [Depth estimation from monocular images and simultaneous mask generation]()

   The objective of this project is to handle the joint tasks of:

   - predicting the depth of the background given a single image file (i.e no LiDAR or RGB-D data) 
   - Reliable recreating image masks for the foreground objects/people.
